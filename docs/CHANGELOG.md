# Devserver Changelog

Top-level changelog. Sub-projects keep their own detailed changelogs; link them
here.

## Data pipelines
Garmin / banking / Playnite / AoE4-replay / X-bookmarks pipelines on Dagster
(+ DBOS / Restate experiments). Full detail:
[`pipelines/docs/CHANGELOG.md`](../pipelines/docs/CHANGELOG.md).

## Agent container toolbox mounts (2026-05-29)
- Mounted `/projects/toolbox` into `agent-devbox` at `/home/ankit/toolbox` and
  `/home/ankit/.agents` read-only, matching its read-only `/projects` workspace.
- Mounted `/projects/toolbox` into `openclaw` at `/home/ankit/toolbox` and
  `/home/ankit/.agents` read-write, matching its read-write `/projects` workspace.
- Kept other services unchanged because they do not consume the devbox-style agent home.

## OpenClaw (2026-05-27)
Re-added OpenClaw as two compose services (`agent-devbox` left untouched):
- `openclaw` — gateway, thin image `docker/openclaw/` (`FROM ankit/devbox:1.4` + `npm i -g openclaw`).
  State restored from `volumes/openclaw` (bind-mounted to `/home/ankit/.openclaw`). Gateway on
  `127.0.0.1:18789`.
- `agent-browser` — generic chromium + Xvfb + x11vnc + noVNC sidecar (`docker/agent-browser/`,
  vendored from upstream openclaw's `Dockerfile.browser`). CDP relay on `9222` (auth-gated, internal
  to `mybridge`); noVNC GUI on `127.0.0.1:6080`. Renamed from `openclaw-browser` because it's not
  openclaw-specific — any agent on `mybridge` can drive it via the auth-gated CDP endpoint.
OpenClaw drives the browser only over CDP (`browser.profiles.sidecar`, `attachOnly: true`,
`cdpUrl: …@agent-browser:9222`), so no GUI lives in the gateway container. Secrets via
`config/openclaw.env.tmpl` → `just rs`.
Recipes: `just oc-build` / `oc-up` / `oc-logs` / `ab-logs`. Caddy routes:
`openclaw.dev.ankitson.com` → gateway, `agentbrowser.dev.ankitson.com` → noVNC. See [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md).

## MCPProxy gateway (2026-06-02)
- Added a host-networked `mcpproxy` service backed by the shared `ankit/mcpproxy:0.35.0` image.
- Added a seed-once Fastmail upstream configuration with OAuth scopes, direct default routing,
  disabled code execution, disabled telemetry, and mandatory downstream MCP authentication.
- Added a dedicated 1Password-backed admin env template and operator recipes for targeted startup,
  logs, health, Fastmail OAuth, downstream token creation, and authenticated smoke tests.
- Persisted MCPProxy live config, OAuth state, and token hashes in the sensitive `mcpproxy_data`
  named volume.
